   This project is a front-end page only. It's incloud the moving control, and Chat boot. The moving page is the same as the previous task, but the difference is the chat boot.
I linked the page with chat boot using API. There's a json file in the repositorie. This is a link to the page (https://faisalmvc.github.io/moving_control_with_chat_boot/).
